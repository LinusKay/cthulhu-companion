A butler is usually employed as a domestic servant for a large household. Traditionally the butler is charge of the dining room, wine cellar and pantry, and ranks as the highest male servant. Usually male—a housekeeper would be the female equivalent—the butler is responsible for male servants within the household. The duties of the butler will vary according to the requirements of his employer. A valet or lady's maid provides personal services, such  as maintaining her employer's clothes, running baths, and effectively acting as a personal assistant. The work might include making travel arrangements, managing their employer's diary, and organizing household finances. ",

Many clergy (not just Catholic priests) bear witness to confessions and, though they are not at liberty to divulge such secrets, they are free to act upon them.

        description: "America has always generated new religions, from the New England Transcendentalists to the Children of God, as well as many others, right up to modern times. The leader is either a firm believer in the dogma they impart to the cult's members or simply in it for the money and power. During the 1920s, any number of charismatic cult leaders emerge. Some espouse forms of Christianity while others incorporate Eastern mysticism and occult practices. These groups are particularly familiar to America's West Coast but are found all around the country in different forms. The southern Bible Belt supports many traveling tent shows featuring song, dance, and gospel revival. Other countries also see such fringe religions springing up wherever there are those in need of something to believe in.",

Money frees the dilettante to be eccentric and outspoken.

Many physicians are employed by large urban hospitals, allowing them to specialize in areas like pathology, toxicology, orthopedics, and brain surgery. Doctors may also serve as part- or full-time medical examiners, conducting autopsies and signing death certificates for the city, county, or state. In the U.S., physicians are licensed by individual states, most requiring a minimum of two years' attendance at an accredited medical school. These requirements, however, are but a relatively recent development. During the 1920s, many older physicians first obtained their licenses long before such strict regulations were in effect, despite never attending medical school.",

Local Representatives and Senators elected to state houses enjoy a fair amount of respect, particularly with the business community and often at a statewide level. Governors are responsible for entire states and have connections across the country. Federal positions carry the most clout. States send a number of Representatives to Congress based upon population count, and the House seats over 400 members, each elected to a two-year term. Each state, regardless of size, also sends two Senators to Washington. Elected to six-year terms and numbering less than a hundred, Senators hold considerably more influence than Representatives, and some elder Senators receive nearly as much respect as the President. In the United Kingdom, Members of Parliament are popularly elected every four to five years.
