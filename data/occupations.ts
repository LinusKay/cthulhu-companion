Neighborhood ethnic gangs, who had heretofore limited their activities to local protection schemes and small gambling rackets, discovered the immense profits to be made in the illegal beer and liquor industry. Before long they controlled whole sections of cities and warred with one another in the streets. Though most gangs are of ethnic origin—Irish, Italian, African-American, and Jewish— gangsters of nearly all nationalities are found within the ranks. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n In modern times, the drug trade has overtaken other forms of organized crime to be the most lucrative route for many. Operating on very similar lines to their 1920s counterparts, the contemporary gangster boss also needs a range of underlings to promote, secure, and trade their business on the streets.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n Aside from illegal liquor and narcotics, organized crime deals in prostitution, protection, gambling, and many other forms of corruption.",

Underlings usually have specific areas of responsibility, such as overseeing illicit shipments, collecting protection money, and so on. The boss oversees the business, makes deals, and determines how to solve problems. For the most part, the gangster boss is untouchable, able to wield a small army of underlings to do his or her bidding, and so is unlikely to get their hands dirty. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n Gangsterism rose to prominence in the 1920s. Neighborhood ethnic gangs, who had heretofore limited their activities to local protection schemes and small gambling rackets, discovered the immense profits to be made in the illegal beer and liquor industry. Before long they controlled whole sections of cities and warred with one another in the streets. Though most gangs are of ethnic origin—Irish, Italian, African-American, and Jewish— gangsters of nearly all nationalities are found within the ranks. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n In modern times, the drug trade has overtaken other forms of organized crime to be the most lucrative route for many. Operating on very similar lines to their 1920s counterparts, the contemporary gangster boss also needs a range of underlings to promote, secure, and trade their business on the streets.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n Aside from illegal liquor and narcotics, organized crime deals in prostitution, protection, gambling, and many other forms of corruption.",

A major portion of their time is spent debunking fake mediums and mistaken phenomena rather than recording actual evidence. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n Some parapsychologists will specialize in the study of particular phenomenon, such as extra sensory perception, telekinesis, hauntings, and others. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n Prestigious universities grant no degrees for parapsychology. Standards in the field are based entirely upon personal reputation, and so the most acceptable representatives tend to hold degrees in related areas— physics, psychology, or medicine. Those who choose this path are unusually sympathetic to the notion of invisible mystical powers and in validating that belief to the satisfaction of physical scientists. This would represent an unusual cohabitation of faith and doubt— the parapsychologist may have difficulty separating the con icting desires. A person uninterested in observation, experimentation, and proof is not a scientist, though he or she may be an occultist",
