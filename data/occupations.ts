      "Most likely a general practitioner, surgeon, or other specialist, such as a psychiatrist or an independent medical researcher. Apart from personal goals, three aims—helping patients, gaining money and prestige, and promoting a more rational and wiser society—are common to the profession. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf a general practitioner, the doctor will be based in a rural or neighborhood practice in or near a small town or city. Many physicians are employed by large urban hospitals, allowing them to specialize in areas like pathology, toxicology, orthopedics, and brain surgery. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nDoctors may also serve as part- or full-time medical examiners, conducting autopsies and signing death certificates for the city, county, or state. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the U.S., physicians are licensed by individual states, most requiring a minimum of two years' attendance at an accredited medical school. These requirements, however, are but a relatively recent development. During the 1920s, many older physicians first obtained their licenses long before such strict regulations were in effect, despite never attending medical school.",

Governors are responsible for entire states and have connections across the country. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nFederal positions carry the most clout. States send a number of Representatives to Congress based upon population count, and the House seats over 400 members, each elected to a two-year term. Each state, regardless of size, also sends two Senators to Washington. Elected to six-year terms and numbering less than a hundred, Senators hold considerably more influence than Representatives, and some elder Senators receive nearly as much respect as the President. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Members of Parliament are popularly elected every four to five years.
